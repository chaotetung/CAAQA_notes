# Foreword
- Moore's Law: the maximum number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.
- Dennard Scaling: the reduction of MOS supply voltage is ***in concert with*** the scaling of feature sizes, so that as transistors get smaller, their power density stays roughly constant.
- New technologies such as 2.5D stacking, new nonvolatile memories, and optical interconnects have been developed to provide more than Moore.
- Today single-core performance is improving very slowly.
